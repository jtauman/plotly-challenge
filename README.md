# Belly Button Biodiversity!

This challenge focuses on creating a dashboard for data gathered by the Rob Dunn lab at N.C. State.  For the Belly Button Biodiversity project subjects volunteered to have their navels swabbed to collect microbes.  These swabs were then plated for a couple of days to allow the microbes to grow.  DNA was extracted from the plated microbes and then sequenced to give a unique 'portrait' of microbes for each volunteer subject. See the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) for more detailed information about the project.

My Belly Button Biodiversity [dashboard](https://jtauman.github.io/plotly-challenge/) provides options to select a volunteer suject, which then returns basic demographic data from the subject, a bar chart of the top 10 microbes found within the subject's belly button, and a bubble plot returning all microbes found for that volunteer.
